You did nothing wrong. Consistency for statistics with XDP is a known
issue, see [1].  The behavior varies per driver, which obviously is bad
from a user perspective.  You NIC is based on ixgbe driver, which don't
have ethtool stats counters for XDP, instead it actually updates
ifconfig counters correctly. While for mlx5 it's opposite (p.s. I use
this[2] ethtool stats tool).

We want to bring consistency in this area, but there are performance
concerns.  As any stat counter will bring overhead, and XDP is all
about maximum performance.  Thus, we want this counter overhead to be
opt-in (that is not on as default).

Currently you have to add the stats your want to the XDP/BPF program
itself.  That is the current opt-in mechanism.  To help you coded this,
we have an example here[3].

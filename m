Hi Jesper:

Thanks for bringing this to xdp-newbies. I would definitely welcome
others to get involved. I had high hopes that this use case would fall
out of zabiplane work, but that project died.

Right now the code is integrated into in my repo for my convenience as I
move between hosts and VMs. If / when others get involved, I am open to
moving the code for the cloud host use case to another repo (under
xdp-project/xdp-cloud-provider?) and setting up lists similar to what
you have for xdp-project as a whole. I also have other code in a private
repository that I can pull over as well â€” e.g., handling decap of vxlan
packets to get the inner packet to do the forwarding lookup. It is best
used with hardware hints which can mark vxlan packets to limit the overhead.

We really need to get the hardware hints code committed it is key to
making this use case a reality.

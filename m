Lorenzo and I both had versions of a patch to propagate rx csum
validation to the VM on xdp redirect. I do not recall a version after
this one:

https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/cover.1622222367.git.lorenzo@kernel.org/

and I lost of track of what change is needed for it to go in.

not that I am aware. Still need tx offloads disabled.


This summarizes what I was looking into back in 2020, along with the
current state of XDP for VM use case:

https://legacy.netdevconf.info/0x14/pub/slides/24/netdev-0x14-XDP-and-the-cloud.pdf

source code is still on github too.

Dear,

I am DR. Magagula Samuel a citizen of South African Director of Contract
Awarding Committee of ANGLO GOLD ASHANTI.

It is my pleasure to inform you of a transaction involving the sum of
Fifty Million United States Dollars ($50, Million) to a foreign account
for safe keeping pending my arrival and my colleagues for the sharing of
the fund in your country.

This money originated from an over-invoiced contract executed for the
co-operation some years back. On completion and inspection of the
contract, the payment voucher was approved and the money involved made
available for the payment to the contractors. We are high profile
officials therefore we are not liable to come for the claim of this money.
We are looking for a competent and honest company or individual abroad
whose particulars will be tendered by us here in South Africa as one of
the Sub-contractors that executed the contract for the collection of this
money.

Upon due consideration, although we have not met before as to know the
extent of your honesty and ours, I personally want to believe that you
will not sit on our money once finally transfer into your account. It is
on this note that I considered it proper asking for your consent,
permission and support to transfer this money into your account. You
should not fear any risk because we have concluded arrangements to
safeguard you in this transaction but at the same time we would not like
you to publicize this transaction for our own safety. Therefore it
requires a high level of secrecy, and confidence.

I shall expect an immediate reply from you if you are willing and capable
to handle this deal. Please note that all correspondence should be
strictly through my email and Phone number, magagulasamuelm@gmail.com +27
78 5711 024
Note we have made all arrangement with the one of the directors with South
Africa Reserve bank on how to transfer this money to your account as soon
as we receive your response it  will not take more than thirty banking
working days for the transaction to be conclude and it is 100% risk free.

Regards,

Dr. Magagula Samuel

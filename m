The interval is currently 1 second (code here[0]), thus the TX interrupt 
should have plenty of time to trigger.

My reproducer[1] need option --zero-copy to enable the error case, as it 
defaults to 'copy-mode'.
It is only in zero-copy mode for igc/i225 that I see the behavior of 8 
packet bulking, when expecting/sending bulks of 4 packets ever second.
